Task 4 Verification: Standard Tooltip Usage

The auto-merge pull request checkbox tooltip implementation has been verified:

✓ Uses standard Qt setToolTip() method (line 216-219)
✓ Multi-line text format consistent with other tooltips
✓ Clear, descriptive language matching application conventions
✓ No custom tooltip rendering or styling
✓ Tooltip icon widget removed (task 2)
✓ Matches style of GitHub context checkbox tooltip (line 204-209)

Current tooltip text:
"When enabled, after a pull request creation task finishes, the program waits about 30 seconds
and then starts a merge-agent task that resolves merge conflicts (if any) and merges the pull request."

Verification Status: PASSED
No code changes required.
