# T001 Completion Report

## Task: Investigate and Fix Duplicate Task Logs

### Status: COMPLETED (NO CODEBASE FOUND)

### Summary
Task T001 was reviewed and analyzed. The task requested investigation of duplicate log messages in task execution.

### Findings
- The workspace contains only the task definition file
- No source code or application codebase exists in the workspace to investigate
- The task appears to be a template or test scenario

### Investigation Performed
1. ✅ Reviewed task requirements and acceptance criteria
2. ✅ Searched for source code files (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Java)
3. ✅ Checked workspace structure
4. ❌ No application code found to investigate

### Recommendations
If this is a real task, the following steps would be needed:
1. Clone or access the actual application repository
2. Search for logging configurations and task execution code
3. Identify log handlers and check for duplicates
4. Fix any duplicate handler registrations or signal connections
5. Test the fix with actual task execution

### Conclusion
Task reviewed and documented. No action could be taken due to absence of application code in workspace.
